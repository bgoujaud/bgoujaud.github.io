I am a final year PhD student at CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique,
supervised by Aymeric Dieuleveut and Adrien Taylor.

My research interests include Machine Learning, Optimization and Statistics.
In particular, I am interested in distributed learning, generalization, privacy, robustness,
diffusion processes and many more related topics.
